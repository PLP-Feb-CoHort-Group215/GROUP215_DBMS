# GROUP215_DBMS E-Commerce Database Design Project

Welcome to our collaborative project where we design and implement a relational database schema for an e-commerce platform! This project involves planning, designing, and delivering a fully structured SQL-based database with clear documentation and team collaboration.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) ‚úçÔ∏è

### Tasks:
- Define **entities (tables)** and their **attributes**.
- Clarify **relationships** between tables.
- Identify **primary keys**, **foreign keys**, and **constraints**.
- Create the ERD using tools like:
  - [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/)
  - [draw.io](https://draw.io/)
  - [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io/)
  - [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/)

> Final ERD will be uploaded in `/docs/ERD.pdf`.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Flow Planning üîÑ

We will map how data flows through our system from one entity to another and define:
- Input/output across tables
- How data connects (e.g., foreign key relationships)
- Considerations for data normalization and scalability

> We'll document our data flow diagrams and logic in `/docs/data-flow.md`.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Group Collaboration ü§ù

### Team Guidelines:
- **Meet regularly** to discuss progress and roadblocks
- **Everyone contributes** to analysis, design, and implementation
- Use GitHub:
  - For **version control**
  - To track progress with **Issues** and **Projects**
  - For **code review** and documentation

### Communication:
- Ask questions early and often
- Share insights and updates in team meetings or GitHub Discussions
